    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼cup fine bulgur wheat</li>
      <li>1small garlic clove, minced (optional)</li>
      <li>Juice of 2 large lemons, to taste</li>
      <li>3cups chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (from 3 large bunches)</li>
      <li>¼cup chopped fresh mint</li>
      <li>½pound ripe tomatoes, very finely chopped</li>
      <li>1bunch scallions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Quarter teaspoon of black pepper</li>
      <li>¼cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1romaine lettuce heart, leaves separated, washed and dried</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until
        well combined. Stir in the bulgur. Let the grains soak up the dressing
        until they are plump and most of the moisture is absorbed for about 20
        to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add the parsley, tomatoes, green onions, and mint to one side
        of the large bowl with the bulgur, but don't mix yet.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the bulgur is plump, and the lemon-olive oil mixture is mostly
        absorbed, stir everything together until well combined. Serve at room
        temperature or chilled from the fridge.
      </li>
    </ol>
